# Activities

> Application security activities are key practices that are performed during the software development lifecycle in order to reduce risk or increase assurance in an application. E.g. Log review and management

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Activity

# Attacks

> Attacks are the techniques that attackers use to exploit the vulnerabilities in applications. E.g. SQL injection

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Attack

# Controls

> [The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA)](https://www.isaca.org/pages/default.aspx) defines control as the means of managing risk, including policies, procedures, guidelines, practices or organizational structures, which can be of an administrative, technical, management, or legal nature.
