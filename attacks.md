# Attacks

> Attacks are the techniques that attackers use to exploit the vulnerabilities in applications. Attacks are often confused with vulnerabilities, so please try to be sure that the attack you are describing is something that an attacker would do, rather than a weakness in an application.

### Abuse of Functionality

- <abbr title="The impact of a maliciously constructed response can be magnified if it is cached either by a web cache used by multiple users or even the browser cache of a single user. ">[Cache Poisoning](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cache_Poisoning)</abbr>
- <abbr title="An attacker can make a single request to a vulnerable server that will cause the sever to create two responses, the second of which may be misinterpreted as a response to a different request, possibly one made by another user sharing the same TCP connection with the sever.">[Cross-User Defacement](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-User_Defacement)</abbr>
- <abbr title="Manipulation of a mobile code in order to execute malicious operations at the client side.">[Mobile Code: invoking untrusted mobile code](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Mobile_code:_invoking_untrusted_mobile_code)</abbr>
- <abbr title="This attack aims to manipulate non-final public variables used in mobile code, by injecting malicious values on it, mostly in Java and C++ applications.">[Mobile Code: non-final public field](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Mobile_code:_non-final_public_field)</abbr>
- <abbr title="This attack consists of a technique to create objects without constructorsâ€™ methods by taking advantage of the clone() method of Java-based applications.">[Mobile Code: object hijack](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Mobile_code:_object_hijack)</abbr>
- <abbr title="A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder.">[Path Traversal](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Path_Traversal)</abbr>
- <abbr title="Abuse of functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The attacker can supply or a modify a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit data to.">[Server Side Request Forgery](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)</abbr>

### Automated Threat

> Threat events (an instance of something causing harm) to applications undertaken using automated actions. The focus is on abuse of functionality - misuse of inherent functionality and related design flaws, some of which are also referred to as business logic flaws. There is almost no focus on implementation bugs.

> In the specific case of web applications, threat events to web applications undertaken using automated actions. And for this web application case, attacks that can be achieved without the web are not in scope.

### Path Traversal Attack

> This category of attacks exploit various path vulnerabilities to access files or directories that are not intended to be accessed. This attack works on applications that take user input and use it in a "path" that is used to access a filesystem

> If the attacker includes special characters that modify the meaning of the path, the application will misbehave and may allow the attacker to access unauthorized resources. This type of attack has been successful on web servers, application servers, and custom code.

> E.g. http://foo.com/../../barfile

### Sniffing Attacks

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Sniffing_application_traffic_attack

> Sniffing application traffic simply means that the attacker is able to view network traffic and will try to steal credentials, confidential information, or other sensitive data.

> Anyone with physical access to the network, whether it is switched or via a hub, is likely able to sniff the traffic. (See dsniff and arpspoof tools). Also, anyone with access to intermediate routers, firewalls, proxies, servers, or other networking gear may be able to see the traffic as well.
